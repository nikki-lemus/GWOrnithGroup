- then they will make image files of these and put them in the repository
- images will be included in markdown files
- ALex will make maps
- Katherine will edit working csv and make visualization of info (phylo)
- Chase will make visualization of data
- Nikki will manage files and make biodiversity exploration


*list of who does what*
*will involve using R packages and writing /editing code to make figures*
*this should have a record of add/commit/.../merge and also at least one tag*
