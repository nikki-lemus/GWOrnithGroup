# Bunker data

Overall goal:Taking bunker resurvey data and making figures including maps, maybe biodiversity or spp counts

## making a working data set

-clean data
*will involve people working independently on the original file, pushing and pulling to GitHub to get our ultimate working data set*
*working data set should be tagged*

## making figures
-individuals will take this data and use R to make some figures
-then they will make image files of these and put them in the repository
*list of who does what*
*will involve using R packages and writing /editing code to make figures*
*this should have a record of add/commit/.../merge and also at least one tag*
